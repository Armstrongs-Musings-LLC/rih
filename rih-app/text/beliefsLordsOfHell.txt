Everything in the universe heeds hierarchies. From the lowliest lobsters to the gods themselves, everything has an order. 
The powerful, the capable, and the strong are at the top; the weak,
the foolish, and the incapable at the bottom. It is the natural order of things.

Since the humans destroyed the original lords of Hell, chaos has reigned and everything - everything - that was built over millennia
has been destroyed. If we continue like this, we will eventually bring every aspect of our world to ruin. 
The only answer is a return to order, to bring the wild demons and radicals to heel. Since they will not
listen to reason, the only road to peace is through war.
