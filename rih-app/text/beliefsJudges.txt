Hell, and indeed the entire universe, has rules. Rocks fall to
the ground, fire burns away wood, souls are indivisible. For most, the
prima facie rules of the universe are all they ever contemplate and in
this, they find only folly and ruin.
The rules of Hell give one power. There are secret truths, a math of
the cosmos, the great algebra that all demons dance to without seeing their own strings. We the Judges see these secret rules and can
do with our marionettes as we please.
