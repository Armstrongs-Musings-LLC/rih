The Demented are correct that there is no more purpose to
Hell. With the connection to the mortal world forever closed, their
role is no more. Where they are wrong is they seek to embrace this
ennui, carried along through the chaos of Hell like a leaf floating on a
river.

The truth is that Hell is without purpose, and it can have only one
end: complete destruction. Demons, the realms, and everything here
down to the smallest atom must be obliterated, cast into the void.
We fight to gather the souls necessary to bring about the true end of
all things.
