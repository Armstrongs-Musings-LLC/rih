Hell was made for a purpose – suffering. Trying to make order of it is the height of foolish hubris. Those who struggle endlessly
against their chains only serve to rub their wrists raw.
The wise embrace the chaos, the madness – the nihilism. Others
search for purpose in this Hell, for meaning, as if they were mortals calling out in the dark, mewling to their pathetic gods. Meaning
comes only when one realizes that none of this means anything and
all are here to suffer – demons included
